# 💧 Drink Water Game Edition

This project is a game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, inspired by Brad Traversy's "Drink Water" app.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to fill the jug **exactly** using the available glasses. It requires strategic thinking to find the right combination with the fewest moves possible.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The jug has a fixed capacity.  
- There are 4 glasses with different water amounts.  
- Use the glasses to try and fill the jug completely.  
- Each use updates the jug’s fill level.  
- You succeed if the jug is filled precisely; otherwise, the game continues.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

> Note: The game features a **responsive (mobile-friendly)** design.
